This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Transformer model in EEG signal prediction compared to fully connected neural network. 
Using the ChineseEEG dataset, this project conducted experiments with  Autoformer and DLinear models, finding that DLinear consistently demonstrated lower prediction errors and computational costs.

Code for implementing Autoformer and DLinear models: https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear
